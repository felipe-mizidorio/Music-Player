<h1>Music Player</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In this repository, I created a Music Player using Java, to be more specific, I used the package
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/sound/sampled/package-summary.html">javax.sound.sampled</a>
to created this program. So now on, it is possible to play some musics wich contains the extension <b>.wav</b>, giving the repository path from your
computer. Unfortunatelly, it is not possible to play <b>.mp3</b> or other extensions in this program.
</p>

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>When you execute the program, firstly you need to enter the repository path wich contains the songs that you want to listen. If you type the wrong path, or
a path that is not a folder, the program will not work and it will automatically close. So keep it sure to enter the correct path.</p>
<p>Also, if the folder doesn't have any music with the extension specified lately, the program will not play anything, and will close it.
But, it doesn't matter if you have others files on your repository, if you have at least one music with the extension <b>.wav</b>, the program will recognize
and play it for you.</p>
<p>So, entering the correct path, it will automatically play the music. And now on, you have some options to choose:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Play</b>: to play the music</li>
  <li><b>Stop</b>: to stop the music</li>
  <li><b>Reset</b>: to reset the music and play it from the beggining</li>
  <li><b>Next</b>: if you have more than one music, it will play the next music from the list</li>
  <li><b>Previous</b>: if you have more than one music, it will play the previous music from the list</li>
  <li><b>Quit</b>: to exit the program</li>
</ul>
<p>To choose these options, you should type the correspondinng letter or symbol:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>P</b>: Play</li>
  <li><b>S</b>: Stop</li>
  <li><b>R</b>: Reset</li>
  <li><b>></b>: Next</li>
  <li><b><</b>: Previous</li>
  <li><b>Q</b>: Quit</li>
</ul>
<p>When you reach to the end of the music list, the program will exit</p>
